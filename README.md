This scenario takes place in enterprise of financial consulting.

Two datasets of stocks, their price and their expected profit rate are given. One person of the enterprise has chosen a list of stocks to buy with a determined budget of 500.

The goal is to develop two algorithms, first one with brutal force, second one optimized, and thern compare results with the proposition of the employee.

Objectives of the project:
    - Discover how algorithms work
    - Develop algorithms
    - Measure and compare algorithmic performances - Big O notation

Clone the remote repository and follow the instructions below

# I. Use brute force algorithm

From terminal, launch via the command

    $ python bruteforce.py

Dataset and budget are directly integrated to the script

# II. Use optimized algorithm

From terminal, launch via the command

    $ python optimized.py

Follow the instructions and choose one of the dasatets integrated into the repository by entering 1 or 2 into the terminal

# III. Results description and analysis
